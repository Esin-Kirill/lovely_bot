# Lovely bot

It's Telegram Bot. That I created as personal project for testing pytelegrambotAPI lib.
And, yeah, I wrote it for my girlfriend. So bot has some features, here what bot can do:
- sending lovely msgs every morning at certain time
- providing a link to check current weather
- providing a link to listen to songs
- sending link with google search results
- sending different quotes with funny pictures
- helping to make a choice (you just tap a button and get your result -- yes/no/maybe with a gif)

Features I plan to add in future:
- translation
- human like dialog
